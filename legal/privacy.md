# DrugBank Privacy Policy

_Effective April 19, 2016_

DrugBank is a unique bioinformatics and cheminformatics resource owned by The Governors of the University of Alberta (the **"University"**) that combines detailed drug data with comprehensive drug target information. DrugBank is managed by OMx Personal Health Analytics Inc. (**"OMx"**, **"us"** or **"we"**).

Delivery of a unique database that combines detailed information about pharmaceutical drugs with drug target information to users (**"Users"**, **"you"**) requires us to collect and retain certain identifying information. We take privacy seriously and will take reasonable steps to protect this information. We will not disclose any personal information without the consent of Users.

This Privacy Policy (the **"Policy"**) sets out how we use, protect, collect and preserve information submitted by Users. Any capitalized terms not defined in the Policy have the same meaning as defined in the Terms of Use, which are available on the DrugBank website (www.drugbank.ca) and should be read in conjunction with the Policy.

By submitting and accessing information through the DrugBank or web based application, be it www.drugbank.ca, www.drugbankplus.com, www.omx.io, or any other website directly directing traffic thereto, (collectively, the **"Platform"**), you are agreeing to the terms of this Policy.

**_You are prohibited from using the Platform unless you fully understand and agree to the Terms of Use and the Policy._**

If you have any questions about the Terms of Use or the Policy, please send an email with your questions to info@drugbank.ca before accessing or entering any information on the Platform.
